This app helps calculating irradiation energies accross the year for different
surfaces at any location on earth.
This can be a starting point to lay out a solar installation or get an idea
about the effectiveness of window shading.

Checkout the [app here](https://sunposition.kehei.de), but be kind, it's only running
on my VPS 😇.
